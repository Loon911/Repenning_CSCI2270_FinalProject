# Repenning_CSCI2270_FinalProject

I have no team.

My project is going to be about uploading and reading cooking ingredients from a file and to be able to take inventory of the ingredients. I might use a hash table or vectors. When you start the program you have the option of reading a file or making a new file. Then once it's read or you made a new file, you can now store data on this file.
